# Velux Active Integration to Homebridge

First of all - big thanks to nougad for reverse engineering how the velux api works.

It was the basis of this module.

I know that you can directly add the Velux Active to Apple homekit, but at some
point I was so fed up with Homekit since sometimes automations wouldn't work for 
some stupid reason - therefore I decided to integrate everything in node-red and 
so I needed this plugin to control the velux devices I have. 

Maybe it is also useful for some of you too :)
